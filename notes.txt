we have not created a superuser yet.

We have NOT done makemigrations or migrate yet. As of creating resource Model

created resource model; created 3 views, but did not write them; created forms.py and copied over from django-albums;

worked on views functions and html pages with Gerardo in class

Made superuser: SuperUser, password = password
Is this pushed to the branch? -> I don't think so.

added media_type to fields in forms.py

removed date_added from fields in forms.py
added from .forms import ResourceForm in views.py; also fixed a typo
