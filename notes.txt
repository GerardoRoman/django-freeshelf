have we done startapp already? I don't think so.
we have not created a superuser yet.

We have NOT done makemigrations or migrate yet. As of creating resource Model

created resource model; created 3 views, but did not write them; created forms.py and copied over from django-albums;

worked on views functions and html pages with Gerardo in class

==============================================
Made superuser: SuperUser, password = password
Is this pushed to the branch? -> I don't think so.
==================================================

added another MEDIA_TYPE in models.py and migrated
added media_type to fields in forms.py

removed date_added from fields in forms.py
added from .forms import ResourceForm in views.py; also fixed a typo
started delete_resource.html and edit_resource.html
